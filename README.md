## The Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) 1939-1945

With the approach of WW2 the need for airmen, pilots gunners etc., was dire and prompted the establishment of a network of training bases throughout the commonwealth (including Australia, Canada and New Zealand) This resulted in a massive addition of aircraft facilities in the host countries which persist, for the most part, in some form to today. Though the runways continue to be usable and often regularly used, unfortunately many facilities have fallen in disrepair.

There is a collection of BCATP scenery (Flight Ontario, Al Gay, Grant Wilson) for older flight simulators available (FSX and FS2004 Prepar3d etc.) these have been slow to be promoted to X-Plane (and FS 2021).  This project is to I hope remedy this beginning with the base and aerodrome of my long ago hometoen of Picton, Ontario, Canada. I home more will follow.

## Development

I was introduced to modern flight simulation with X-Plane and found scenery development quite approachable first modeling with AC3D and more recently open source Blender. Layout/overlay development has in my hands been with World Editor (WED) and a myriad of open object libraries. BCATP and Wartime architecture is sparse necessitating my learning Blender to develop H-Huts, barracks, hangers (Single, Double and Double-Double) in antique textures. I am learning still, and the more one uses the rich modeling environment which is Blender, the more I realize one will alway be in learner mode. The objects are freely available (MIT license) and I hope they represent a quality others will want to use.
